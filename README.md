
# Xsens MTi ROS Driver and Ntrip Client

This code was based on the official ``xsens_ros_mti_driver`` and tested on MTi-680 with ubuntu 20.04 LTS, ROS noetic.

## ROS vs ROS2 Versions

Note that this branch contains the ROS implementation for the packages. If you are looking for the ROS2 version, you should go to the [`ros2`](https://github.com/jiminghe/Xsens_MTi_ROS_Driver_and_Ntrip_Client/tree/ros2) branch

## Device Settings - Output Configurations
#### Note: the UTC Time, SampleTimeFine, Status Word, Latitude and Longitude needs to be enabled, in order to get GPGGA data for topic ``/nmea``: MT Manager - Device Settings - Output Configuration , select "UTC Time, Sample TimeFine, Status Word, Latitude and Longitude" and other required data, click "Apply"

Here are the recommended Output Configurations and Device Settings:

## Changes made to the MTi ROS Driver:

 - add ``xsens_time_handler`` , to give user option to use UTC Time from the MTi sensor.
 - add ``ntrip_util``, to support the /nmea topic
 - add ``xsens_log_handler``, to support the ``should_log`` option in the ``xsens_mti_node.yaml``
 - add ``nmeapublisher.h`` under ``src/messagepublisher`` folder, to send GPGGA message, ``/nmea`` rostopic. The ``/nmea`` messages will be generated by PvtData, but if you have enabled SendLatest Time Synchronization option, you won't be able to get PvtData, even there is trigger, in that case, the ``/nnmea`` messages will be generated by ``packet.UtcTime(), packet.status(), packet.latitudeLongitude()``. The ``/nmea`` messages are published at approximately 1Hz.
 - add ``gnssposepublisher.h`` under ``src/messagepublisher`` folder, to send position+orientation in one message, ``/gnss_pose`` rostopic.
 - add ``utctimepublisher.h`` under ``src/messagepublisher`` folder, to send utctime(if available) , ``/imu/utctime`` rostopic. 
 - add ``XsStatusWord.msg``, used to publish ``/status`` topic

change:
 - ``lib/xspublic/xscontroller/iointerface.h``, line 138, change to ``PO_OneStopBIt`` for PO_XsensDefaults.
 - ``lib/xspublic/xscommon/threading.cpp``, updated to work with glibc 2.35.

## Ntrip_Client
The Ntrip_client subscribes to the ``/nmea`` rostopic from ``xsens_ros_mti_driver``, and wait until it gets data for maximum 300 sec, it will send GPGGA to the Ntrip Caster(Server) every 1 seconds.

User needs to change the ``ntrip.launch`` for their own credentials/servers/mountpoint. 

## How to Install:
install dependency:
```
sudo apt install ros-[ROSDISTRIBUTION]-nmea-msgs
sudo apt install ros-[ROSDISTRIBUTION]-mavros-msgs
```
for example for ROS Melodic:
```
sudo apt install ros-noetic-nmea-msgs
sudo apt install ros-noetic-mavros-msgs
```

clone the source file to your ``catkin_ws``, and run the code below:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws
pushd src/xsens_ros_mti_driver/lib/xspublic && make && popd
catkin_make
```
Source the ``/devel/setup.bash`` file inside your catkin workspace
```
source ./devel/setup.bash
```
or 

add it into rules:
```
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
```
At the end of the file, add the following line:
```
source /[PATH_TO_Your_catkin_ws]/devel/setup.bash
```
save the file, exit.

## How to Use:
change the credentials/servers/mountpoint in ``src/ntrip/launch/ntrip.launch`` to your own one.


open two terminals:
```
roslaunch xsens_mti_driver xsens_mti_node.launch
```
or with the 3D display rviz:
```
roslaunch xsens_mti_driver display.launch
```
and then
```
roslaunch ntrip ntrip.launch
```

## How to confirm your RTK Status

you could check ``rostopic echo /rtcm``, there should be HEX RTCM data coming,

or ``rostopic echo /status`` to check the RTK Fix type, it should be 1(RTK Floating) or 2(RTK Fix).

## Troubleshooting

fatal error: `xsens_mti_driver/XsStatusWord.h : No such file or directory`
- If you had previously installed the official version of MTi ROS Driver, and if you manually delete the build and devel folders, there will be errors, you could do catkin_make again to make it work. It is recommended to use `rm -rf build devel` under your catkin_ws, which ensures that the build and devel directories are completely removed, and forces `catkin_make` to start from scratch, properly setting up the build process and dependencies.
